## Conversion Rate Optimisation

CRO is a term used for the optimisation of a company's website's ability to convert prospects into sales.
This can be done through many forms, but typically relies on an initaial stage of analysis of the current performance of the website, followed by theorisation of ways to iteratively improve on the benchmarked performance, and eventually testing those theorems during experiments.
Such tools that used may include A/B testing, parametric testing, heatmap analysis, feedback gathering and more.
